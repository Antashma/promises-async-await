                    <h2>Explanation</h2>
                    <p>Each practice problem focuses on one specific method:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><code>Promise.all</code>: Requires all promises to succeed.</li>
                        <li>
                            <code>Promise.allSettled</code>: Provides the status of each
                            promise, regardless of the outcome.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>Promise.any</code>: Resolves as soon as any one of the
                            promises succeeds.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <code>Promise.race</code>: Resolves or rejects as soon as any one
                            of the promises settles.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        These problems should help you understand how each
                        method works and how to handle different scenarios using
                        the Promise class.

                    <p>
                        You need to fetch user data, posts, and comments
                        simultaneously. All requests must succeed for the
                        operation to be considered successful.

                        You need to fetch user data, posts, and comments simultaneously. You need to know the status of each request, regardless of whether they succeed or fail.

                        You need to fetch user data, posts, and comments simultaneously. You only need one request to succeed for the operation to be considered successful.

                        You need to fetch user data, posts, and comments simultaneously. You want to use the result of the first request to complete, whether it succeeds or fails.
